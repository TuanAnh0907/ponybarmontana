                <p>Sunday, September 19, 2004<br/>
                    Pony Bar is the beating heart of a ghost town<br/>
                    By ERIN NICHOLES Chronicle Staff Writer</p>
                <p>PONY ~ Michelle Smith rolled into town in the dead of winter, driving a Jeep with no windows. She
                    scanned the empty, red brick buildings for life signs among the ghostly remnants of a once-booming
                    mining camp. At the west end of Main Street, she found a beating heart: The Pony Bar.<br/>
                    Bar owner Scott Lambert won't forget the sight of Smith that day, standing in the old saloon's
                    doorway wearing a stocking cap. &quot;I felt sorry for her,&quot; Lambert said. &quot;He took me in,&quot;
                    said Smith, 26.<br/>
                    Lambert immediately hired Smith, originally from New York state, as a bartender. A year-and-a-half
                    later, she's still in tiny Pony, six miles west of Harrison off of Highway 287. &quot;I like it
                    here,&quot; she said. &quot;The people around here are kind of like family. We fight like family and
                    we love each other.&quot;<br/>
                    If Pony's 100 residents are one big family, the Pony Bar is their living room. It's where ranchers
                    gather after branding. It's where football fans watch Monday night games. It's where veterans'
                    groups meet and hunting buddies tell stories. And the bar has a reputation for welcoming outsiders
                    from all walks of life.<br/>
                    On Saturday nights, pickup trucks line an otherwise empty Main Street. Inside the 130-year-old
                    building, people from three counties crowd the bar, their laughter and music breathing life into an
                    otherwise dead town.<br/>
                    &quot;It's a real Montana bar,&quot; said Lambert, hooking the heels of his dirty cowboy boots on
                    the rung of a bar stool. &quot;That's what the draw is.&quot; </p>
                <p>The last best bar</p>
                <p>The Pony Bar is all that is left of once-thriving local commerce. &quot;Its the only business that
                    survived; it was always kind of a miners' bar,&quot; said bartender Bruce Flesch, who is a living
                    portrait of an Old-West barkeep in his black vest over a white shirt, finished with an arm garter
                    and bolo tie.<br/>
                    Pony was born in 1875 as a gold miners' camp. Thousands of people lived here and there were schools,
                    banks, Chinese laundries and saloons, according to visitmt.com.<br/>
                    The Pony Bar originally was McKittrick Hall, built in 1877 as a town meeting hall and boarding
                    house, and later, was a house of ill repute, Flesch said. After Pony went belly-up in the early
                    1900s, a salty woman named Bert Welch bought the hall and opened Bert's Pony Bar. She had a
                    reputation for opening promptly at 8 a.m., and closed promptly 10 hours later. &quot;She didn't care
                    if the bar was packed full, she closed at 6 p.m.,&quot; said Dave Halvorson, a longtime resident and
                    bar regular.<br/>
                    After Welch died, the bar changed hands a few times until Lambert took over two years ago, when he
                    was living in Harrison and spending spare time at the saloon.<br/>
                    &quot;The guy who owned it asked me to buy it a few years ago,&quot; said Lambert, 47. &quot;I said
                    'no.' Then I thought, you only live once, so what the hell.&quot; He, his girlfriend and his twin
                    teenage boys now live in part of the building formerly used as a boarding house. &quot;My bed's
                    about 10 yards from the bar,&quot; he said. </p>
                <p>Rough and ready</p>
                <p>The Pony Bar serves as the town hall, veterans' lodge, restaurant, senior center and leading
                    employer. &quot;This is the gathering place,&quot; Halvorson said, as he drained a Rainier with his
                    wife after work one recent afternoon. &quot;If you want to see somebody, you come to the Pony Bar.&quot;<br/>
                    Miners, loggers, ranchers and bikers are the most regular customers here. &quot;I cater to them,&quot;
                    Lambert said.<br/>
                    He sells cheap drinks and opens tabs because he knows many customers only get paid once a month. He
                    serves free food on Monday nights and stays open 365 days a year so lonely people always have a
                    place to spend holidays.<br/>
                    And the decor reflects Pony's tough-going mining and ranching roots.<br/>
                    Antique taxidermy, old mining-claim signs, black-and-white photographs, saddles and horse tack line
                    the brick walls. A painting of scantily clad prostitutes posing in front of a horse-draw wagon
                    always seems to have at least one onlooker. A collection of raw-humored bumper stickers sits above
                    the bar, including one that says, &quot;My Montana has an East infection.&quot;<br/>
                    Halvorson has been coming here for years to drink beer and tell stories about things that happen,
                    &quot;only in Pony.&quot;<br/>
                    He recalled a cold day one hunting season when a herd of cow elk trotted down the street past the
                    bar, which sits just a few miles from access to the Tobacco Root Mountains. &quot;Everybody sitting
                    here said, 'Anybody got a cow elk tag?',&quot; Halvorson said. &quot;But everybody who did was up on
                    top of the mountain and the elk just walked right through town.&quot;</p>
                <p>Open hearts</p>
                <p>The Pony Bar, with its creaky hardwood floors and musky beer scent, is unique because although it
                    caters to people like Halvorson, it welcomes everyone. &quot;We don't judge people,&quot; Lambert
                    said. &quot;You can't judge people by how they look, but we'll sit around a while and see how they
                    act.&quot;<br/>
                    On Saturday nights, people from Pony, Harrison, Whitehall, Cardwell, Three Forks and even Bozeman
                    fill the bar to dance, to eat burgers and ribs, laugh over drinks and listen to live music, should
                    someone happen to show up to play.<br/>
                    &quot;Locals will pick up their guitars and start playing,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Everybody's open
                    to everyone. The strangest people come in and people end up talking to them.&quot;<br/>
                    Last year, a man known only as &quot;Hillbilly Evan&quot; hitchhiked here from Arkansas with a
                    guitar, thick glasses and long, curly hair. Lambert let Hillbilly sleep in the beer room and
                    designated him the night watchman. A few months later, the community embraced him.<br/>
                    &quot;Around Christmas time, everybody pitched in and bought him a guitar,&quot; Smith said.
                    Hillbilly now rents a cabin and works odd jobs around the area. Every Saturday night, he is with his
                    friends at the bar. The way the community rallied for Hillbilly is typical of Pony, Halvorson said.
                    &quot;If you need any help with anything you're doing, everybody in town shows up to help,&quot; he
                    said.</p>
                <p>Bucking trends</p>
                <p>Like all of Montana, Pony draws more tourists every year. Some come to the nearby Potosi Hot Springs
                    and others have just heard of the town and want to poke around the old buildings. Many stop in the
                    bar to ask about the town's history, and Flesch can deliver information.<br/>
                    Lambert knows he could tap the tourism industry, but he's not interested. &quot;If something's
                    working, don't change it,&quot; he said, holding a cigarette between thick, meaty fingers.<br/>
                    Even his advertising is old-school. He regularly visits other bars in the area and buys the house a
                    round of drinks to spread the word about the Pony Bar. &quot;That's how they used to do it in the
                    old days,&quot; he said.<br/>
                    The only major improvement he's making is restoring the boarding rooms to rent out in the future. He
                    wants the Pony Bar to continue serving locals, as it has for decades after riding out economic
                    turbulence and evolving society. And he wants the bar to continue serving as Pony's first embrace
                    for newcomers like Smith, who said she may leave here someday, but she's content for now. &quot;Time
                    will tell,&quot; Smith said.</p>
